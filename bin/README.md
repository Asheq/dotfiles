This folder is added to PATH by .sh/login.sh.

It should be used to store executables (e.g., scripts, binaries, AppImages)
that are managed manually rather than by a package manager like Homebrew.

Since this folder is checked into the repository, it should not contain
original binaries or AppImages. Instead, it should only contain symlinks to
those files stored elsewhere.
