This folder is included in PATH by .sh/login.sh

It is checked into my dotfiles repository. It should not contain original
scripts, binaries, or appimages. Instead, it should contain symlinks to them
located elsewhere. The only exceptions are scripts, binaries, or appimages that
should themselves be checked in (rare).
