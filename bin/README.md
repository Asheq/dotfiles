This folder is included in PATH by .sh/login.sh.

It is intended for storing the user's own executables (scripts, binaries,
appimages, etc.).

It is checked into the repository. Thus, it should not contain original
binaries or appimages. Instead, it should contain symlinks to them located
elsewhere.

There are some old symlinks in here that point to Linux appimages. I don't use
them anymore, but I am leaving them in here as an example.
