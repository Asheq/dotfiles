This folder is included in PATH by .sh/login.sh.

It is intended for storing the user's own executables (scripts, binaries,
appimages, etc.).

It is checked into the repository. Thus, it should not contain original
binaries or appimages. Instead, it should contain symlinks to them located
elsewhere.
