Think about how to automatically get the latest version of these files periodically from https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/completion

Look into options:
- Are these file packaged into brew's git package itself somewhere?
- Does brew have a separate package for these files?
- Can I use the git repo itself and update/pull from it?
